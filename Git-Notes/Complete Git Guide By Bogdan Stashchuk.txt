1) Visual Studio code can be used as a default editor for Git.
2) iTerm2 is more convenient to use than default Terminal application on MacOs.
3) Bash-shell(default shell) and Z-shell (custom shell) are two options available to use with iTerm2.
4) iTerm2 with custom Z-Shell is a good combination. We need to install Z-Shell.
5) Two componenets - oh-My-ZSH and Zsh needs to be installed. Oh-My-Zsh is a framework for zsh configuration management.
6) Oh-My-Zsh allows different configuration options and custom themes for Zsh.

If we commit some file by mistake, we can untrack that file from local repo back to the working directory.
